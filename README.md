# Library-Management
Devon Gilliard

This Library Management System is designed for managing and maintaining libraries in any educational institution
through an integrated computerized system. The library management software will allow librarians to operate more
productively while handling the typical day-to-day tasks of a library. 
The proposed project seeks to solve all the challenges associated with the traditional library management system. 
Since it stores and manages all the library records in a computerized database, it eliminates the need for manual
record-keeping. The software includes different modules, each of which handles and manages specific library 
operations.
